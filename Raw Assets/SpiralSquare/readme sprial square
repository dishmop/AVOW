How to make the square spiral textures.
------------------------------------

Place the two script files; SpiralSquare_Specular.scm and SpiralSquare.scm in the folder ~/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.8/scripts

Get gimp to refresh scripts (Filters->Script-fu->Refresh Scripts)

The specular texture is what we use as our defuse texture in the shader

Make the specular texture
----------------------------
Open RivetSpecular.png in Gimp and then go to File->Create->Text->Spiral Square Specular

This will generate a 1024X1024 image


Now open Blemish_Specular.png and paste this into a background layer of the image we just generated. Set the opacity of the generated image to be 60%.

Export as PNG to assets dir.

Make the Normal map
Open RivetNormal.png and then run the script File->Create->Text->Spiral Square

This will generate a 1024X1024 image

Now open BlemishNormal.png and paste this into the background (no need to adjust the opacity).

Save in assets.

Ensure the when this is imported it is imported as a normal map and "Create from greyscale" is disabled.
